It describes and connects all sections: Include topic, main idea, aims, model and method /types of analyses used, and findings and conclusions. Approximate length: 120 words +/- 10\%.]}}

\section*{Introduction}
\textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{[The introduction of this technical report includes a bit of background and purpose of the project. Identify the subject, background information on its development and use, the aims of the project’s analyses, and the purpose of the project. A complete literature review is usually part of professional communications, to inform the reader of the current state of the research on the subject. A very brief version of that is appropriate here:}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{Please cite 2-3 sources (no links to websites, e.g. Wikipedia – use scholarly/professional sources) used to inform your writing of this section}}
  \item \textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{Include all citations in your list of References. The Reference list should be on its own page.}}
  \item \textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{The IEEE referencing style should be used.}}
  \item \textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{Approximate length: 150-200 words.}}
\end{enumerate}
\textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{Example: In this example sentence I refer to one of my own publications on MEMS technology \cite{gutschmidt2024} to make you aware of the IEEE standard \cite{IEEE} which is mostly used for engineering articles and reports. (The work cited here is totally unrelated to the project!)]}}

\section*{Model Description}
\textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{[In this section, briefly describe the model and underlying assumptions. This includes using figures with figure descriptions and referencing to these in the text.]}}

\section*{Method}\label{sec:method}
\textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{[This section brings parts 1 and 2 of the project together. Begin with 1-2 sentences explaining the overarching method of using Newton’s/Euler’s method to bring together kinematics (part1) and dynamics (part 2) to generate the EOM.  Include any constraint equations (as part of the analysis, if applicable). Details of the method will then be explained in the following sub-sections: Kinematics, Dynamics and Equations of Motion.]}}

[\textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{This section mainly contains content of Project Part 2. Briefly describe the derivation of the equation(s) of motion.

\section*{Analysis \& Discussions}\label{sec:anal_disc}
[\textcolor[rgb]{0.80,0.29,0.09}{\textsl{This section mainly contains content of Project Part 3. Present results professionally by relating figures/graphs to equation numbers, describing graphs and observations, and discussing results and their meaning.]}}
