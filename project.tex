% ----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Kinematics}\label{sec:kin}
Since the centre of rotation is not in the same place as the centre of mass for this system, it is neccessary to derive kinematic relations between angular velocities/accelerations and relative translational velocities/accelerations.
\begin{align}
  v_{G/F} &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
     \dot{\theta}l_{\theta}\sin\theta \\
    -\dot{\theta}l_{\theta}\cos\theta \\
  \end{pmatrix} \label{eq:kin1} \\
  a_{G/F} &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
     \ddot{\theta}l_{\theta}\sin\theta + \dot{\theta}^2l_{\theta}\cos\theta \\
    -\ddot{\theta}l_{\theta}\cos\theta + \dot{\theta}^2l_{\theta}\sin\theta 
  \end{pmatrix} \label{eq:kin2}
\end{align}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption{...}\label{fig:kin_sketch}
\end{figure}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Dynamics}\label{sec:dyn}
The equations of motions use the format of the basic translational and rotational mass/dampener/spring systems:
\begin{align*}
  m\ddot{y} + d\dot{y} + ky &= F \\
  I\ddot{\theta} + d_{\theta}\dot{\theta} + k_{\theta}\theta &= T
\end{align*}
The symbols $F$ and $T$ represent external force and torque acting upon the system, which for this model is just the lift force acting at point A
\begin{align*}
  m\ddot{y} + d\dot{y} + ky &= L = C_{\theta}U^2\theta + C_yU\dot{y} \\
  I\ddot{\theta} + d_{\theta}\dot{\theta} + k_{\theta}\theta &= l_{\alpha}\theta = l_{\alpha}(C_{\theta}U^2\theta + C_yU\dot{y})
\end{align*}
Then, since the centre of rotation is not in the same location as the centre of mass, the equations must be linearized, giving the final equations of motion:
\begin{align}
  m\ddot{y} - ml_{\theta}\ddot{\theta} + d\dot{y} + ky &= L = C_{\theta}U^2\theta + C_yU\dot{y}\label{eq:eom1} \\
  I\ddot{\theta} - ml_{\theta}\ddot{y} + d_{\theta}\dot{\theta} + k_{\theta}\theta &= l_{\alpha}\theta = l_{\alpha}(C_{\theta}U^2\theta + C_yU\dot{y})\label{eq:eom2}
\end{align}
This is a 2 degrees of freedom system, hence why there are two seperate equations of motion. This is because the translational and rotational properties of the system are not completely dependent upon each other. However, they are \textsl{partially} dependent, which is why there is sharing of quantities between equations. These are known as coupled equations.

\subsection*{Decoupled Analysis}\label{sec:coupled_analysis}
As stated in the Dynamics section, the equations of motion for this system are coupled, this means the equations can not be analysed induvidually, but rather as a system of differential equations.
However, it is possible to set specific conditions where the equations decouple from each other, this occurs when the centre of mass and flexural axis are aligned ($l_{\theta} = 0$), and the lift coefficient associated with the equation in question's quantity is set to zero ($C_y$ or $C_{\theta} = 0 $). \\\\
Case 1, where $l_{\theta} = 0$ and $C_y = 0$ results in an equation of motion for rotation of
\begin{equation}
  \ddot{\theta}+\frac{d_{\theta}}{I^F}\dot{\theta}+\frac{k_{\theta}-l_{\alpha}C_{\theta}U^2}{I^F}\theta = 0 \label{eq:decoupled1}
\end{equation}
This equation can then be considered with the format $\ddot{q} + 2\zeta\omega\dot{q}+\omega^2q = 0$, giving the formulas for frequency and damping ratio:
\begin{align*}
  \omega &= \sqrt{\frac{k_{\theta}-l_{\alpha}C_{\theta}U^2}{I^F}} \\
  \zeta &= \frac{d_{\theta}}{2\sqrt{I^F(k_{\theta}-l_{\alpha}C_{\theta}U^2)}}
\end{align*}
This information allows us to find a critical airspeed where the wingsuit's torsional mode becomes statically unstable.
This critical airspeed occurs when the real component of the roots (given by $\lambda = -\zeta\omega\pm i\omega\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$) of the equation of motion equal zero.
Given a positive value for $d_{\theta}$, the equation for $\zeta$ cannot be zero, so to find the solution, $\omega$ must be set to zero. This gives:
\begin{align*}
  k_{\theta} &= l_{\alpha}C_{\theta}U^2 \\
  U &= \sqrt{\frac{k_{\theta}}{l_{\alpha}C_{\theta}}}\\
    &= 100~\mathrm{m/s}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Modal Analysis}\label{sec:modal_analysis}
Modal analysis allows us to see the stability of the system as a whole when both degrees of freedom are partially interacting.
To analyse both equations of motion simultaneously they can be represented in a matrix system of the form
$$
  \mathbf{M}\ddot{X}+\mathbf{D}\dot{X}+\mathbf{K}X = 0
$$
Then substituting in equations \ref{eq:eom1} and \ref{eq:eom2}
$$
  \overbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      I^F&-ml_{\theta} \\
      -ml_{\theta}&m
    \end{bmatrix}
  }^{\mathbf{M}}
  \overbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \ddot{\theta} \\
      \ddot{y}
    \end{bmatrix}
  }^{\ddot{X}}
  +
  \overbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      d_{\theta}&-l_{\alpha}C_yU\\
      0&d-C_yU
    \end{bmatrix}
  }^{\mathbf{D}}
  \overbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \dot{\theta} \\
      \dot{y}
    \end{bmatrix}
  }^{\dot{X}}
  +
  \overbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      k_{\theta}-l_{\alpha}C_{\theta}U^2&0\\
    -C_{\theta}U^2&k
    \end{bmatrix}
  }^{\mathbf{K}}
  \overbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \theta \\
      y
    \end{bmatrix}
  }^X
  = 0
$$
This system can then be converted into state space
\begin{align*}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    I&0\\
    0&M
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dot{X}\\
    \ddot{X}
  \end{bmatrix}
  +
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0&-I\\
    K&D
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    X\\
    \dot{X}
  \end{bmatrix}
  &=0
  \\
  \frac{d}{dt}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    X\\
    \dot{X}
  \end{bmatrix}
  &=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    I&0\\
    0&M
  \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0&I\\
    -K&-D
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    X\\
    \dot{X}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
This system is suitable for use with an initial value problem numerical solver, and we can analyse the behavior of such a system by finding the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix
$$
  A = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    I&0\\
    0&M
  \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0&I\\
    -K&-D
  \end{bmatrix}
$$
The roots of this system can then be plotted against Airspeed using an eigenvalue finder. \\
A system is unstable if the real parts of any of its eigenvalues is postive, and Figure \ref{fig:modal_roots} shows that the system has positive real components for approximately $U > 30$ m/s, meaning this wingsuit model is not very stable at the reasonably high speeds needed for flight.
